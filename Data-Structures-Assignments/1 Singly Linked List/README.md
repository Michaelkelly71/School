# Singly Linked list

## **Singly** Linked List is a sequence of **links** which contains elements or data at link postions. Each link contains a connection to another link in one direction.

## Classes

### Contains 3 classes
- **Node** : A node class
- **SinglyLinkedList** : Hold the main method 
- **SinglyLinkedList** : Contains all implementations for this program 

## Main Method
    ### public static void main() : this method runs the code and has the control on start

## Constructor 
### Uses overloaded constructors
    There is a parameterized constructor with argument (data as in entry)
    There is a parameterized constructor with argument (Node n as in node postion)


## Implementations

### Contains 6 Methods
- **insertAtLast** : A method that adds entered data at the end of the list
- **insertAtFirst** : A method that adds entered data at the beginning of the list
- **insertAfter** : A method that adds entered data at a particular index of the list
- **deleteList** : A method that deletes entered data at a particular index of the list
- **deleteRecursively** : A method that deletes a specified element recursively.
- **dsiplay** : display all elements in the linked list.

## How to run Code
-   Open in prefered IDE
-   navigate to the .java file with main infront of it
-   In vs code : Select Run in the menu bar and click on start debugging
