# Stacks

## Classes
- **mainStack** : Holds the main method
- **StackTest** : This class holds the methods for implementations with generics S
- **mainStack** : Holds the main method
- **Node<N>** : A node class with generics


# Main Method
### public static void main() : this method runs the code and has the control on start

## Constructor 
### Uses overloaded constructors
    Parameterized constructor with argument (size as size of Linked list)
    parameterized constructor with argument (Generic N entry as data added)


## Implementation

### Contains 7 Methods
- **push** : A method to add data to the stack.
- **pop** : A method to remove data from the stack.
- **peek** : A method that returns the last element or top element of the stack.
- **isStackEmpty** : A method to check if the stack is empty.
- **isStackFull** : A method to check if the stack is full(past its size).
- **getEelemets** : A method that returns the number of elements in the stack.
- **dsiplay** : A method displays the linked list after any implementation
