# Queues

## Classes
- **mainQueue** : Holds the main method
- **classQueues<T>** : This class holds the methods for implementations with generics
- **Node<T>** : A node class with generics


# Main Method
### public static void main() : This method runs the code and has the control on start

## Constructor 
### Uses overloaded constructors
    Parameterized constructor with argument (n as node position of Linked list)
    parameterized constructor with argument (Generic N entry as data added)
    parameterized constructor with argument (size as the size of the linked list)


## Implementation

### Contains 7 Methods
 - **setLink** : Method to set Link to next Node

- **first** : A method to add data to the stack.
- **enqueue** : Method to add data after the current last node.
- **dequeue** : A method to remove data from the begining of the stack.
- **peek** : A method that returns the last element or top element of the stack.
- **getHead** : Method to get the startin element of the queue.
- **isQueueEmpty** : A method to check if the stack is empty.
- **isQueueFull** : A method to check if the stack is full(past its size).
- **getEelemets** : A method that returns the number of elements in the stack.
- **dsiplay** : A method displays the linked list after any implementation.
